**AI-Augmented Senior Data Engineering Consultant**  
I help teams build **scalable, resilient data platforms** — and future-proof them with **GenAI-driven workflows**.

---

## 🚀 What I Do

I work with fast-moving teams to design, optimize, and modernize data systems that actually hold up in production.

My focus sits at the intersection of:

- **High-scale data engineering**
- **Cost-aware cloud architectures**
- **AI-augmented pipelines & agent-driven workflows**
- **Real-world reliability (not slideware)**

I care less about buzzwords — and more about **impact, stability, and outcomes**.

## 🧠 Areas of Expertise

**Core Data Stack**
- Databricks · Apache Spark · Kafka
- Airflow · Custom orchestration patterns
- AWS (S3, data & compute primitives)

**Data Engineering**
- Large-scale batch & streaming pipelines  
- Chunked processing for fault-tolerance & resilience  
- Custom CDC implementations  
- Performance optimization & cost reduction

**GenAI & AI-Augmented Systems**
- LLM-powered data workflows
- RAG architectures
- Agent-based automation
- AI-assisted analytics & engineering productivity

---

## 📈 Selected Impact

- Built and optimized a **complex Gene Expression Pipeline** processing data in intelligent chunks — **dramatically reducing failure rates** and improving recoverability at scale.
- Designed **custom CDC mechanisms** for non-trivial data sources where off-the-shelf tools fell short.
- Helped teams move from “it works locally” to **production-grade, observable, and scalable** systems.

## 🎤 Speaking, Teaching & Community

I actively share real-world lessons from the field:

- **Panel Speaker** — AWS Cloud Club (2025)
- **Panel Speaker** — AI Nexus
- **Panel Speaker** — Cloud Nexus
- **Talk** — *The Future of Data Engineering in the Age of AI Agents* (Dice Analytics, Islamabad)
- **Workshop** — Data Lakes at COMSATS University, Islamabad

I also mentor engineers transitioning into **senior and consulting roles**.

Expect fewer platitudes — more patterns, trade-offs, and honest takes.

---

## 🌍 How I Work

- Consulting-first mindset  
- Outcome-driven, not tool-driven  
- Comfortable collaborating across time zones  
- Experience working with globally distributed teams
